## Course Description:

This seminar course will cover a mixture of modern and classical methods for robot cognition. We will review papers related to task planning and control using both symbolic and numeric methods. The goal of this course is to give students an overview of the current state of research on robot cognition.

### Representations and Abstractions

[Representations and Abstractions](16-890%20Robot%20Cognition%20for%20Manipulation%20491afe6c2471458f8748d1a11c058a71/Representations%20and%20Abstractions%203b427b3a777f49e6947826225d826dfd.md)

- How should robots represent their environment
- How should robots represent their actions and policies
- What abstractions can robots make

### Planning and Reasoning

- How can robots plan a series of actions to complete a task

### External Knowledge

- How can robots leverage cultural knowledge
- How can robots leverage large offline datasets

### Prior Experiences

- How should robots learn from prior experiences
- What does robot memory look like

### Communication

- How should robots effectively communicate with humans
- How should robots effectively communicate with other robots
